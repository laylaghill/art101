            <p id="body">My name is Layla and my partner's name is Gabriel. I'm a first year Psych major and Gabriel is a third year AGPM major. Combined, we only have a bit of coding experience. This assignment tripped us both up a bit because CSS is a hassle to customize and link. But, overall we did pretty well for our experience and knowledge on the subject.
