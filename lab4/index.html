					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Pseudocode a simple video game with tasks and subtasks. Add this code as comments in this lab folder's Javascript file. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The example provided in the module seemed far more advanced than what we had been learning in class. Myself and my partner both didn't understand the code that was there. We didn't understand that the assignment was JUST pseudocoding rather than actual coding. When we realized this, the lab became much easier. </p>
