					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab seemed really intimidating at first. I kept going back and looking at the AJAX slideshow hoping that it wpuld make sense, but it didn't. I realized then that I had been watching the wrong lecture, so I found the original AJAX lecture and followed along. It was pretty easy once I found the right instructions. My only other problem was with the APIs. For some reason, only the Chuck Norris one seemed to work for me.</p>
