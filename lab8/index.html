					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This whole assignment has been very difficult for me. I really don't understand functions in-depth and the class is moving too fast for me to keep up with my understanding. I eventually figured out how to do this, but it took a while. I tried to complete Task X but I just couldn't do it. </p>
