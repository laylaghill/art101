					<h3>Lab 2</h3>
						<p>I had an error show up in the console saying that my stylesheet wasn't linked correctly. To fix this, I removed the site-wide CSS link and left only the lab-specific one. When I reloaded after doing this, I had no bugs.</p>

					<h3>Lab 6</h3>
						<p>When I opened the console for Lab 6, it said, “ SyntaxError: Identifier 'myTransport' has already been declared (at lab.js:1:1).” I was a bit confused about what this meant, so I asked ChatGPT what this error was. It turns out, I had forgotten to delete the link to javascript at the header of my html. When I fixed this, everything was fine.</p>

					<h3>Lab 7</h3>
						<p>I had a similar issue with this lab as I did the last one. I had forgotten to take out the link to javascript at my header, so the pop up would show up two different times. It could only perform the function once, so it came up with an error. When I removed the first link from my html, everything was fixed.</p>
